  Chocolate or cocoa is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19thâ€“11th century BCE),[1][2] and later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.
